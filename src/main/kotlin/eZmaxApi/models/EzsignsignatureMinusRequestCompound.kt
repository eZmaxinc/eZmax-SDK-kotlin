/**
 * An Ezsignsignature Object and children to create a complete structure
 * @param fkiEzsignfoldersignerassociationID A reference to a valid Ezsignfoldersignerassociation.  That value is returned after a successful Ezsignfoldersignerassociation Creation. 
 * @param iEzsignpagePagenumber The page number in the document where to apply the signature
 * @param iEzsignsignatureX The X coordinate (Horizontal) where to put the signature block on the page.  Coordinate is calculated at 100dpi (dot per inch). So for example, if you want to put the signature block 2 inches from the left border of the page, you would use \"200\" for the X coordinate.
 * @param iEzsignsignatureY The Y coordinate (Vertical) where to put the signature block on the page.  Coordinate is calculated at 100dpi (dot per inch). So for example, if you want to put the signature block 3 inches from the top border of the page, you would use \"300\" for the Y coordinate.
 * @param iEzsignsignatureStep The step when the Ezsignsigner will be invited to sign.  For example, if you say iEzsignsignatureStep=2, that block of signature will be available for signature only after ALL the signatures in step 1 are completed.
 * @param eEzsignsignatureType The type of signature required.  1. **Acknowledgement** is for an acknowledgment of receipt. 2. **Handwritten** is for a handwritten kind of signature where users needs to \"draw\" their signature on screen. 3. **Initials** is a simple \"click to add initials\" block. 4. **Name** is a simple \"Click to sign\" block. This is the most common block of signature.
 * @param fkiEzsigndocumentID A reference to a valid Ezsigndocument.  That value is returned after a successful Ezsigndocumentation Creation.
