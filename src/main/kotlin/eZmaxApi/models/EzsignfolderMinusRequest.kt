Valid values:  |Value|Description| |-|-| |1|No. TSA Timestamping will requested. This will make all signatures a lot faster since no round-trip to the TSA server will be required. Timestamping will be made using eZsign server's time.| |2|Best effort. Timestamping from a Time Stamping Authority will be requested but is not mandatory. In the very improbable case it cannot be completed, the timestamping will be made using eZsign server's time. **Additional fee applies**| |3|Mandatory. Timestamping from a Time Stamping Authority will be requested and is mandatory. In the very improbable case it cannot be completed, the signature will fail and the user will be asked to retry. **Additional fee applies**|
 * @param sEzsignfolderExternalid This field can be used to store an External ID from the client's system.  Anything can be stored in this field, it will never be evaluated by the eZmax system and will be returned AS-IS.  To store multiple values, consider using a JSON formatted structure, a URL encoded string, a CSV or any other custom format.
