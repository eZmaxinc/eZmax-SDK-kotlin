 * @param fkiEzsignfoldertypeID The unique ID of the Ezsignfoldertype.
 * @param fkiEzsigntsarequirementID The unique ID of the Ezsigntsarequirement.  Determine if a Time Stamping Authority should add a timestamp on each of the signature. Valid values:  |Value|Description| |-|-| |1|No. TSA Timestamping will requested. This will make all signatures a lot faster since no round-trip to the TSA server will be required. Timestamping will be made using eZsign server's time.| |2|Best effort. Timestamping from a Time Stamping Authority will be requested but is not mandatory. In the very improbable case it cannot be completed, the timestamping will be made using eZsign server's time. **Additional fee applies**| |3|Mandatory. Timestamping from a Time Stamping Authority will be requested and is mandatory. In the very improbable case it cannot be completed, the signature will fail and the user will be asked to retry. **Additional fee applies**|
 * @param sEzsignfolderDescription The description of the Ezsign Folder
 * @param tEzsignfolderNote Somes extra notes about the eZsign Folder
 * @param eEzsignfolderSendreminderfrequency 
 * @param pkiEzsignfolderID The unique ID of the Ezsignfolder
 * @param dtEzsignfolderSentdate The date and time at which the Ezsign folder was sent the last time.
 * @param eEzsignfolderStep 
 * @param dtEzsignfolderClose The date and time at which the folder was closed. Either by applying the last signature or by completing it prematurely.
